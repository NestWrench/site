    <h1>NestWrench Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: November 1, 2025</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>
      These Terms of Service (“Terms”) explain your rights and responsibilities when you use the NestWrench mobile
      application, website, AI diagnostic features, live consult features, or any related services (collectively, the “Service”).
      NestWrench is a service provided by Davidson Enterprises, LLC, located in Crown Point, Indiana, USA (“NestWrench,” “we,” “us,” or “our”).
      By creating an account, accessing, or using the Service, you agree to these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>1. What NestWrench Does</h2>
    <p>
      NestWrench helps homeowners diagnose and resolve home repair and maintenance issues.
      Features may include AI-powered image/video diagnostics (“AI Scan”), maintenance tracking,
      estimated cost guidance, and access to live video consultations with repair professionals
      (“Live Video Consult”).
      We are not a licensed contractor, plumber, electrician, or HVAC company.
      We provide information and connect you with professionals, but we do not directly perform physical repair work.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      You must be at least 18 years old, or the age of majority in your location, to use paid features
      or enter payment details. By using the Service, you confirm you meet this requirement.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Your Account</h2>
    <p>
      You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activity
      under your account. If you believe your account has been compromised, contact
      <a href="mailto:support@nestwrench.app">support@nestwrench.app</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Paid Features and Billing</h2>
    <p>We offer two types of paid access within NestWrench:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>One-time services:</strong> For example, a paid Live Video Consult session with a professional.</li>
      <li><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> For example, NestWrench Pro, which may include benefits like unlimited AI Scans,
          maintenance tracking, and preferred access to support.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By purchasing a one-time service, you authorize us to charge your payment method for that session.
      By starting a subscription, you authorize recurring charges until you cancel. Unless otherwise stated,
      subscriptions renew automatically each billing cycle (e.g. monthly). You can cancel future renewals
      anytime in the app under <em>Account → Manage Subscription</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you cancel, you keep access through the end of your already-paid billing period.
      Your bank or card statement will display charges as
      <span class="mono">NESTWRENCH APP</span>.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Refunds</h2>
    <p>
      If you are charged but did not receive access to the purchased service or subscription features,
      email us at <a href="mailto:support@nestwrench.app">support@nestwrench.app</a> within 7 days.
      Include purchase date, amount, and the last 4 digits of the card. Refunds are handled case-by-case.
      We do not guarantee refunds for dissatisfaction with advice, outcomes, or DIY results.
    </p>

    <h2>6. No Professional Liability</h2>
    <p>
      Any guidance, recommendations, troubleshooting steps, or cost estimates from NestWrench or a Live Video Consult
      are informational only. You are solely responsible for deciding whether and how to proceed with any repair.
      Many repairs (for example: electrical, gas, structural, roofing, or water intrusion) can be dangerous
      or require a licensed professional. Follow local code, permit requirements, and safety standards.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Pros / Contractors</h2>
    <p>
      NestWrench may connect you with independent service providers.
      These providers are not employees or agents of NestWrench or Davidson Enterprises, LLC.
      We do not supervise their work, guarantee pricing, guarantee availability,
      or accept responsibility for work performed in person.
      Any in-person work you book is a separate agreement between you and that provider.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reverse engineer, copy, or resell our software or AI models.</li>
      <li>Use the Service for unlawful activity, fraud, or harassment.</li>
      <li>Upload content that is illegal, hateful, or violates someone else’s privacy or IP rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      All logos, branding, product names (including “NestWrench”), user interface layouts, text, and other
      content in the Service are owned by or licensed to Davidson Enterprises, LLC.
      You may not use our brand identity, marks, or content without written permission,
      except as allowed by law.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Service Changes and Availability</h2>
    <p>
      We may update, pause, or discontinue parts of the Service at any time.
      Features (including number of AI scans, consult minutes, etc.) may change as we improve or reprice the product.
      We may suspend or terminate your access if we detect abuse, fraud, or violations of these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the fullest extent allowed by law, NestWrench and Davidson Enterprises, LLC are not responsible for:
      (a) indirect, incidental, or consequential damages;
      (b) loss of data, property damage, or personal injury related to using any guidance from the Service;
      (c) work performed (or not performed) by third-party providers introduced through the Service.
      Some locations don’t allow certain liability limits; in those places, our liability is limited
      to the maximum amount allowed by law.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Indiana, USA,
      without regard to conflict-of-law rules.
    </p>
